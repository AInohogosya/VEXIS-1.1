VEXIS-1 is a powerful vision-based AI agent for GUI automation that uses computer vision to understand and interact with graphical user interfaces.

## 🏛️ Name Origin

The name "VEXIS" is derived from the Latin word *Vexillum* (military standard/guiding flag). It represents a "flag bearer" that raises the user's intentions and guides the system through chaotic OS environments.

## 🤖 Features

- **Vision-based automation**: Uses computer vision to understand GUI elements
- **Two-phase architecture**: Task list generation + sequential execution
- **Cross-platform support**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Ollama Models**: Supports various AI models via Ollama (local and cloud)
- **Screenshot capture**: Takes and analyzes screenshots for visual understanding
- **GUI automation**: Performs clicks, typing, scrolling, and other interactions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installation (optional for cloud models)
- Ollama running locally for local models (optional for cloud models)
- Ollama account (required for cloud models only)

### Platform Support

**Note**: This project has been primarily tested on macOS. While it is designed to work on Windows and Linux as well, cross-platform compatibility may vary. The codebase includes platform-specific dependencies for all three major operating systems, but testing has been focused on macOS environments.

### Installation

#### Step 1: Set up Ollama

1. **Install Ollama**:
   - Download and install Ollama for your operating system from [https://ollama.ai/download](https://ollama.ai/download)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your platform

2. **Start Ollama service**:
   - Open your terminal/command prompt
   - Run: `ollama serve`
   - Verify it's running at `http://localhost:11434`

3. **Set up Ollama account for cloud models** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Sign in to your Ollama account for cloud model access
   ollama signin
   ```
   
   **Note**: Cloud models require an Ollama account. After signing in, Ollama automatically handles authentication for cloud models when using the local API endpoint.
   
   **Alternative**: For direct API access to `https://ollama.com/api`, you can use an API key from [https://ollama.com/settings/keys](https://ollama.com/settings/keys) and set the `OLLAMA_API_KEY` environment variable.

#### Step 2: Clone and Install VEXIS-1

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AInohogosya/VEXIS-1.git
cd VEXIS-1
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

**Note**: The program will automatically check for missing dependencies and prompt you to install them if needed.

### Usage

Run VEXIS-1 with a simple command:

```bash
python3 run.py "your instruction here"
```

**Examples:**
```bash
python3 run.py "Take a screenshot"
python3 run.py "Open the calculator and perform 2+2"
python3 run.py "Open a web browser and navigate to google.com"
```

For debug mode:
```bash
python3 run.py "your instruction" --debug
```

## 🧠 AI Models Used

This project primarily uses:
- **AI Models via Ollama** - Local and cloud-based models for vision-based tasks
- **Ollama API** for model inference

## 📋 Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- `Pillow>=10.0.0` - Image processing
- `pyautogui>=0.9.54` - GUI automation
- `opencv-python>=4.8.0` - Computer vision
- `numpy>=1.24.0` - Numerical computations
- `pynput>=1.7.6` - Input device control

### AI/ML Dependencies
- `openai>=1.0.0` - OpenAI API support
- `anthropic>=0.7.0` - Anthropic API support
- `transformers>=4.35.0` - Hugging Face transformers
- `torch>=2.1.0` - PyTorch

### Platform-specific Dependencies

## ⚙️ Configuration

The agent can be configured via `config.yaml`:

```yaml
api:
  preferred_provider: "ollama"
  local_endpoint: "http://localhost:11434"
  local_model: "gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud"
  timeout: 120
  max_retries: 3
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project uses a two-phase architecture:

1. **Task Generation Phase**: Analyzes the instruction and generates a task list
2. **Execution Phase**: Sequentially executes each task with visual feedback

### Key Components

- `TwoPhaseEngine` - Core execution engine
- `ScreenshotCapture` - Handles screenshot capture and processing
- `GUIAutomation` - Manages GUI interactions
- `ModelRunner` - Interfaces with AI models

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ollama connection failed**: Make sure Ollama is running at `http://localhost:11434`
2. **Cloud model access denied**: 
   - Ensure you've run `ollama signin` with a valid Ollama account
   - Verify your account is in good standing
3. **Cloud model not found**: Ensure the model `gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud` is available in your region
4. **Permission denied**: On macOS, you may need to grant accessibility permissions for screen recording and keyboard control
5. **Import errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
