## ⚙️ Configuration

### Runtime Configuration

VEXIS-1.1 uses `config.yaml` for system-wide settings:

```yaml
api:
  preferred_provider: "ollama"  # "ollama" or "google"
  local_endpoint: "http://localhost:11434"
  local_model: "gemini-3-flash-preview:latest"
  timeout: 120
  max_retries: 3
  # API keys are managed interactively for security
```

### Command Interface
```bash
python3 run.py "instruction" --help           # Complete option reference
python3 run.py "instruction" --debug          # Verbose execution logging
python3 run.py "instruction" --no-prompt      # Skip provider selection
```
